# Levenshtein_Distance
In this homework I calculate the Levenstien distance between popular website domain names.<br>
The results below show the distance between the top 10 websites to the next 90.<br>
The shortest distances are 3. 8 in total were found. These were matches like "IRS" and "IMDB".<br>
All in all, this does not seem to be a large risk.<br>
